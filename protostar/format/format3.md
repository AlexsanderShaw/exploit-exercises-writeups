Let's take a look at the source code...

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int target;

void printbuffer(char *string)
{
  printf(string);
}

void vuln()
{
  char buffer[512];

  fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);

  printbuffer(buffer);
  
  if(target == 0x01025544) {
      printf("you have modified the target :)\n");
  } else {
      printf("target is %08x :(\n", target);
  }
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  vuln();
}
```

Looking at this code, it is essentially the same as the previous challenge. The difference this time is we have to have the target 
variable equivalent to the hex value 0x01025544, instead of 64. I will be covering three different ways on how to do this, the
first is the one that I originally used to pwn the program.
