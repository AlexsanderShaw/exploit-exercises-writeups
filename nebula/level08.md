So when we look in the challenge directory, we see a PCAP file whihc is a network packet traffic capture file. We can analyze this using wireshark, however we will need to transfer this to our host machine. We can do that using a tool called netcat, which is essentially the swiss army knife networking tool.

To do this, first your host machine we will have to setup a netcat listening session. This will setup a listener on our local machine on port 3333, that will close after it has recieved the file.

```
guyinatuxedo@tux:~$ nc -l -p 3333 -q 1 > capture.pcap
```

Now on your nebula vm, you will need to send the file using netcat. This will essentially print out the contents of the pcap file over netcat, to our listener at the ipv4 address 192.168.1.78, port 3333. You will need to change this to match the ip address of the host machine. If this doesn't work, try pinging your host machine and if that doesn't work you will proably need to change your vmware network settings.

```
$ cat capture.pcap | nc 192.168.1.78 3333
```

Now that the file appears to have been transferred, let's confirm it using the file utillity.

```
guyinatuxedo@tux:~$ file capture.pcap
capture.pcap: tcpdump capture file (little-endian) - version 2.4 (Ethernet, capture length 65535)
```

So this tells us that the file transferred successfully, and that it retains it data. To trully know if it is an exact copy we would need to hash both files and compare the two, but we don't need to do that now.
Now we are just going to look at the file in Wireshark.

```
guyinatuxedo@tux:~$ wireshark capture.pcap
```
