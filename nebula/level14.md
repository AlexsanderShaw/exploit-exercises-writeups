Let's feed this program a bunch of text and see what it does to it.

```
$ echo "0000000000" | /home/flag14/flag14
0123456789
$ echo "aaaaaaaaaa" | /home/flag14/flag14
abcdefghij
``` 

So looking at this, it seems pretty clear what this does. It takes each ascii character, converts it to decimal, adds the value that is equivalnet to it's position like if it was an array, then convert's it back into ascii.
For example, "0" when converted to decimal is 48. The first zero you see there would be in position zero, so it wouldn't have anything changed about it. The next value would be in position one, so it would have one added to it's decimal value, giving us 49, which when converted into ascii gives us 1.

So now tha we know the encryption algorithm, we can just decrypt it using a python script.

```
#import the sys library so we can open files

#Variable to store the decrypted text
decrypted = ""

#Variable to store the current position
position = 0

#This loop will open the file we are looking for
with open("/home/flag14/token","r") as g:
  #This loop will actually run the decryption
   for i in g.read()[:-1]:
      #This wil reverse the ascii offset
      decrypted += chr(ord(i) - positon)
      #This will kep track of the psiton
      position += 1
#And we print out the decrypted mesage
print decrypted
```
